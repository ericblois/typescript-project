My music is described as 'Soulful Blues aged & seasoned in Americana Folk Roots.' I play mainly original songs, but can perform a fair amount of covers in my own adapted blues/folk/grass style, if you prefer. I also perform with other musicians of all sorts as a Duo, Trio, or a Full Band.\",\n    address: \"1 Westmount Square\",\n    city: \"Westmount\",\n    province: \"Quebec\",\n    postalCode: \"H3Z2P9\",\n  },\n  {\n    userID: \"def456\",\n    name: \"Squeegee Boys\",\n    profileImage: \"https://efirstbankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Denny-640x565.jpg\",\n    galleryImages: [\n      \"https://thecleaningcrewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/window-cleaning-1-1024x784.jpg\",\n      \"https://media.angieslist.com/s3fs-public/styles/widescreen_large/public/windowcleaning900p_0.jpg?itok=GexPfp1w\",\n    ],\n    businessType: \"Property Maintenance\",\n    totalRating: 1.2,\n    description: \"Squeegee Boys is a full service window cleaning company catering to all commercial and residential cleaning needs in Montreal, Quebec.
